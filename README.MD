## Description

> A website that allows users to add new blogs, delete and edit existing blogs. Existing blogs can be sorted by name and dates. Moreover, blogs can be bookmarked and viewed on a separate page. A search function is built to allow users to find their created blogs easily by searching the blog names.

> Blogs are loaded and saved in localstorage API currently.

> If given more time, I will like build an user login system and extend the backend stack of this website.

### Technologies

1. SASS
2. React
   - React Hooks
   - React Router DOM
   - React Transition Group

> Due to the simplicity and ease of styling on the components, I opted for SASS to build this blogsite. As I had not been using SASS alot, this project serves as an opportunity for me to put it into practice.

> After picking and learning my first frontend web framework, I fell in love with React and wanted to build my understanding for all the React concepts and hooks. Performing a month of arduous practice, I built my first project using React and it was a fun project.
